Say Hello Closed
Let’s practice our method writing syntax! Prepare a method say_hello that takes one argument. That argument is the name of the person to be greeted. The method should then print on the screen a greeting to that person. For example:

def say_hello(name)
   "Hello " + name
end

puts say_hello("Jack")

Using the TDD technique, fix the add_two method so that it works with Strings. Use this code to get started.

# Add 2 to the number.
def add_two(number)
  if number.respond_to? :+
    if number.respond_to? :push
      number.push 2
    else
      number + 2
    end
  end
end

def test_add_two
    p add_two(1)
    p add_two(1.0)
    p add_two(nil)
    p add_two({})
    p add_two([])
    p add_two(false)
end

test_add_two



Here’s a new Ruby syntax we haven’t seen yet.
%w[a b c d]
Using introspection, figure out what this syntax does. Tell us what you discover.

Introspection - examining classes, methods and keywords to know what they are, what they do and what they know.

One way of introspecting something… drop it into irb and take a deeper look at it!

Next, keep digging and figure out the difference between these last two lines of code:

a = 1
%w[#{a} b c d]
%W[#{a} b c d]

he %w[] creates an Array of Strings.
%W does string interpolation (“-strings), %w does not (‘-strings).




Super Special Closed
pets = ["Scooby", "Soco", "Summer", "Pixie", "Wilson", "Mason","Baron", "Brinkley", "Bella"]

Write a method that takes in the pets array as a parameter. Inside that method, iterate over the array using the each method. If the name starts with an “S”, output the message “My name starts with an S for super!” If the name does not begin with an “S” output the message: “I’m still pretty special too!”.
